#summary How the Office-o-tron validates your documents

= General =

The Office-o-tron validates ODF or OOXML documents using two validation layers:

 * schema validation
 * programmatic application of normative constraints specified in the standards.


== ODF Schemas ==

The appropriate ODF schema is selected using the version attribute on root elements of XML documents.

The ODF schemas (certainly prior to version 1.2) exhibit a common construction error[1] that occurs when RELAX NG schemas use ID/IDREF types. This is disregarded for the purposes of validation.

== OOXML Schemas ==

OOXML documents are validated against the Transitional variant XSD schemas of ISO/IEC 29500. The validator used is Apache Xerces-J. Since XSD schemas are inherently non-interoperable, the suggested changes of the schema comments are implemented to make them work correctly with this validator.
